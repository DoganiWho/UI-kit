# Welcome to Storybook
Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Storybook runs directly in the repl. Simply hit "run" and off you go!
